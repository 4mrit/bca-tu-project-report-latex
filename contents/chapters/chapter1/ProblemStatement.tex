\section{Problem Statement}
Small and medium business owners often face several difficulties when trying to take their products online. The main problems include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Lack of technical knowledge to build and manage an online shop.
  \item High cost of developing or purchasing an e-commerce platform.
  \item Difficulty in managing products, orders, and customer information manually.
  \item Absence of a simple, user-friendly, and ready-to-use online selling platform.
\end{itemize}

This project aims to address these issues by creating an easy, affordable, and user-friendly e-commerce platform that helps sellers manage their online shop without requiring technical expertise.
