\section{Background Study}
\para{
  E‑commerce is now a powerful way for businesses-especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to reach more customers without a physical store. At the same time, cloud computing is reshaping how these businesses run their operations. Thanks to cloud technology, SMEs no longer need large investments in hardware or servers; instead, they can use scalable and flexible cloud services \cite{jayeola2022ccadoption}}

\para{
Real-world studies show that perceived usefulness and cost-efficiency are important drivers for cloud adoption in SMEs, while concerns about security can slow things down. In one empirical study, researchers found that SMEs with higher organizational readiness are more likely to adopt cloud services (Memon et al., 2025).

\para{Some key benefits for SMEs adopting cloud-based SaaS platforms include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Cost Efficiency:} Businesses can avoid large upfront costs for servers or software licenses and pay for the service as needed \cite{jayeola2022ccadoption}.

  \item \textbf{Operational Performance:} Cloud solutions improve efficiency by automating processes, tracking orders, and streamlining customer management \cite{sastararuji2022cloud}.

  \item \textbf{Ease of Use:} Ready-made platforms require minimal technical skills, allowing shop owners to focus on their business rather than IT issues.

  \item \textbf{Sustainability:} Research in developing countries shows that SMEs can maintain long-term benefits when cloud services are reliable, secure, and affordable \cite{sastararuji2022cloud}.
\end{itemize}

\para{
For this project, the background study focuses on understanding how e-commerce systems work, how SaaS platforms operate, and how small businesses benefit from using ready-made online selling tools. This knowledge forms the foundation for designing a simple, affordable, and user-friendly e-commerce platform suitable for small shop owners.}
